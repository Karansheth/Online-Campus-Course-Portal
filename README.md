# Campus Online Course Portal  
The aim of this project was to make a portal where students can learn subjects of their interest from the expert faculty of that domain. The registered students are allowed to enroll in any course to access the Video Lectures, Class Notes, and any other reference material uploaded by the faculty members for that particular course. The students are required to complete the quiz with more than 80% correct answers to move to the next section in the enrolled course.
